#  WATER SAVING PROJECT
This project aims at saving water in automatic flushing urinals

### PROBLEM  STATEMENT
Automatic flushing urinals waste water due to the automated process that occurs after every set time and upon refill of the water can. 
This leads to more water being used as there are times when there are no users using the urinals but still the toilet flushes

### BACKGROUND RESEARCH
I conducted a physical evaluation of two urinals in the University Of Nairobi  premises, both at ADD and American Wing and I noted that the urinals wasted close to 15 litres of clean water every 10 minutes whether they have been used or not.
This water that goes to watse can be conserved and used for other  activities if a system was to be implemented to monitor the automatic flushing

### SOLUTION
A system that monitors if a person has used the urinal can thus be implemented such that it only flushes after a person has used the urinal, this will work to ensure that water does not continually run after it fills.

### REQUIREMENTS
1. Arduino Board(Arduino Nano)
2. PIR Motion Sensor(HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor)
3. 5V Realy Module
4. Powers Supply(5V)
5. Flushing Mechanism
6. Jumper Wires
7. USB Cable Type A to B

### METHOD
1. Connect the Hardware 
I will upload the images for this connection
* Connect the relay module to the Arduino
* Connect the flushing Mechanism
* Connect the power supply
2. Implement the code in water_saver_arduino.cpp
