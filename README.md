#  WATER SAVING PROJECT
This project aims at saving water in automatic flushing urinals

### PROBLEM  STATEMENT
Automatic flushing urinals waste water due to the automated process that occurs after every set time and upon refill of the water can. 
This leads to more water being used as there are times when there are no users using the urinals but still the toilet flushes
